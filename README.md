# Sign Language Alphabet Recognizer

This project is a sign language alphabet recognizer using Python, openCV and a convolutional neural network model for classification.
The goal of this project is to build a neural network which can identify the alphabet of the American Sign Language (ASL) and translate it into text and voice.

## Dataset
